# Project Title

**Description**   
In three to five sentences describe the project, sponsor, and relevant information Who are the key stakeholders that will be served?


This project has two main areas of focus.  The first part is the development and implementation of open data class for the public.  The second piece of the project will be developing a staff training module around open data literacy. Both components are driven by the project's utility for the Seattle Public Library, and my own interests. The sponsor for this project is SPL's Data Analysis Lead and Open Data Champion, David Christensen.  The two primary stakeholders in this project are the Seattle Public Library and Seattle residents.  

**Goals**     
What is this project supposed to achieve, and why?


- Goal 1:  By the end of this project SPL would like to be able to show increased awareness of the library's participation in the Open Data Program
- Goal 2: Develop an increased awareness of what library data analysts are doing in different areas (i.e. analysis, data collection, performance measurement, etc.)
- Goal 3: Leave SPL with deliverables that provide actionable insight and utility to them moving forward.

**Deliverables**    
What will this project produce? This should include items like software, data, metadata schemas, models or figures, and documentation.

*Interim* 

Throughout this project, I will collect approved workshop materials and versioning of the lesson plans and their development over time.

*End of project*
- A Final deliverable that will be completed at the end of the project (Many interim deliverables will likely add up to a final deliverable)

- The introduction to Seattle Open Data lesson/class that can be utilized in the future.  This class should have measured outcomes and/ or outputs.  The same is true for the staff training lessons as well.

**Plan for Sustainability**       
Describe how you will manage deliverables during the project and the plan for handing over, and sustaining deliverables over time.

Throughout the project, I will maintain pertinent documents, lesson plans, and presentation materials in a folder that David Christensen will be able to access, as well as compile them on the github repository. Once the lessons are complete and the public class has been implemented, I will hand over the complete lesson plan, slides, and all other supplemental materials to David and SPL to be included in their lesson plan library.

**Milestones**    
Create a general timeline for completing each of the deliverables that you listed above. After you have settled on a timeline with feedback from your mentor, you should enter these as `Milestones` in Github's `Issues` tracker. Each task that you perform or plan to perform can then be files as an issue that is attached to a specific milestone.

  -- Week 1:  Develop general themes; turn themes into class title and description for both public/external and staff lessons
  -- Week 2:  Put public class into SPL's calendar of events
  -- Week 4:  Midpoint check-in/ feedback on the development of both lesson plans 
  -- Week 8:  Public class implementation; turn over all associated deliverables to SPL
  **Ongoing updates as necessary
