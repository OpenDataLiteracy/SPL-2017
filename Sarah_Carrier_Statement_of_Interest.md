**1. Background**
I come to the Open Data Literacy Project intern position as a former educator who has a desire to improve our local community through the utilization of data.  Using data as an evaluative tool to ensure an equitable provision of public services has been my primary goal in studying data science and information policy in the Master of Science in Information Management program at the University of Washington's iSchool.

**2. Interest in the Position**
There are several things about this opportunity that have sparked my interest.  This position provides me the opportunity to merge my interest in public service with the data analysis skills I've acquired through my coursework. SPL is an integral part of our Seattle community that works to equitably serve all members of the public, so having the opportunity to aid them in utilizing data to inform their work is truly exciting! 

Another thing that was particularly engaging was the variety of projects proposed by SPL.  The breadth of options would allow me to work on projects that not only interest me, but also allow me to employ and further develop a wide range of skills.   


**3. Project Interests**
I think with the first two projects listed below (#1 and #6 from SPL descriptions) centering around data analysis, there may be an opportunity to combine these; I think this is something that would probably be achievable in the 8 week time frame as well.  

- Describe the effect of internal and/or external events on library usage:

Preliminary explorations into circulation data suggests there may be some correlation between external events (such as weather or road traffic) and in-person branch use. Choose one or more external or internal factor to explore. This example project minimally requires an intermediate knowledge of a statistical programming language or software.

- Describe differences in staffing by branch and region compared to outputs using data. This could include looking at circulation, holds processing, door count, and programming outputs. This example project minimally requires an intermediate knowledge of a statistical programming language or software.

**5. Questions**

- What types of outputs for the projects described above would be useful for SPL?  
- Are there specific analytic or data visualization tools SPL uses/ that would need to utilized for this project?
- Is the data used for analysis in these projects strictly open data, or is other data available as well?
